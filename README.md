# gmail-suffix-generator

A simple email generator that uses the [gmail plus suffix feature]( https://support.cloudhq.net/how-to-setup-gmail-aliases/#:~:text=Append%20a%20plus%20(“%2B”,at%20yourusername%40gmail.com. ) to generate unlimited email addresses which all point to one inbox.
This means u can create multiple accounts for a service while all trafic is pointed to one inbox which is usefull for mass creating accounts.

Be aware a realy small percentage of websites don't allow these types of email adresses.
